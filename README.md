# Deep-Learning-for-Images-Classification

•	Built a deep neural network to predict the class for an input flower image with a dataset consisting of 102 flower categories

•	Performed image data preprocessing (cropping and normalization) and data augmentation to create more training data

•	Trained and explored the performance of the models built upon various Convolutional Neural Network architectures
